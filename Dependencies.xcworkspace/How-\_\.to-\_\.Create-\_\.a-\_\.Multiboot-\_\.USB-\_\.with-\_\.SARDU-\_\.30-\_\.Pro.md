However, SARDU Multiboot Creator 3.0 Pro is not a free software. You need to purchase a license to unlock all the features and benefits of the pro version. The pro version allows you to create unlimited multiboot USB drives, update the ISO lists in real time, download useful software, customize the menu and the graphics, and more. The pro version also supports CD and DVD ISO creation, UEFI boot, and cross-platform compatibility.
 
But what if you don't want to pay for the license? Is there a way to get SARDU Multiboot Creator 3.0 Pro for free? Well, some people might try to find a crack for the software, which is a program that can bypass the activation process and make the software work as if it was registered. However, this is not a recommended option for several reasons.
 
## Why You Should Avoid SARDU Multiboot Creator 3.0 Pro Crack
 
First of all, using a crack is illegal and unethical. You are violating the terms and conditions of the software developer and infringing their intellectual property rights. You are also depriving them of their deserved income and discouraging them from improving their product.
 
Secondly, using a crack is risky and unreliable. You never know what kind of malware or viruses might be hidden in the crack file or where it came from. You might end up infecting your computer or compromising your data and privacy. Moreover, the crack might not work properly or cause errors and crashes in the software. You might also miss out on important updates and bug fixes that the official version provides.
 
Thirdly, using a crack is unnecessary and wasteful. There are other ways to create a multiboot USB drive without using SARDU Multiboot Creator 3.0 Pro or any other paid software. You can use free alternatives that offer similar or even better functionality and performance. For example, you can use Ventoy, Rufus, YUMI, Easy2Boot, or MultiBootUSB to create your own multiboot USB drive with ease and flexibility.
 
## Conclusion
 
In conclusion, SARDU Multiboot Creator 3.0 Pro is a great software for creating multiboot USB drives, but it is not worth using a crack to get it for free. You are better off using free alternatives or buying the license if you really like the software. Using a crack is illegal, risky, unreliable, unnecessary, and wasteful.
  
## How to Use Ventoy to Create a Multiboot USB Drive
 
Ventoy is a free and open source software that can create a multiboot USB drive with just a few clicks. Unlike other software that require you to format the USB drive and extract the ISO files, Ventoy only needs to install itself on the USB drive once and then you can simply copy and paste the ISO files to the USB drive. Ventoy will automatically detect and list the ISO files in a boot menu when you plug in the USB drive.
 
To use Ventoy, you need to download the latest version from its official website: https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html. You can choose between the Windows or Linux version depending on your operating system. After downloading, you need to extract the zip file and run the Ventoy executable file as administrator.
 
Then, you will see a simple interface that shows your USB drive and some options. You need to select your USB drive and click on Install to install Ventoy on it. This will erase all the data on the USB drive, so make sure you back up any important files before proceeding. You can also customize some settings such as partition style, secure boot support, or theme by clicking on Option.
 
After installing Ventoy on the USB drive, you can close the program and start copying and pasting the ISO files to the USB drive. You can use any file manager or explorer to do this. You can copy as many ISO files as you want, as long as they fit in the USB drive. Ventoy supports hundreds of ISO files from various categories such as Windows, Linux, Antivirus, Rescue, Utility, etc.
 
Once you have copied all the ISO files you want, you can eject the USB drive and plug it into any computer you want to boot from. You need to change the boot order in the BIOS or UEFI settings to make the USB drive the first boot option. Then, you will see a Ventoy boot menu that shows all the ISO files on the USB drive. You can use the arrow keys and Enter to select which ISO file to boot from.
 
Ventoy will load the ISO file into memory and run it as if it was burned on a CD or DVD. You can then follow the instructions on the screen to install or run the system or tool you chose. You can also press F1 to access some advanced options such as persistence mode, memdisk mode, or plugin mode.
 
## Conclusion
 
Ventoy is a simple and powerful software that can create a multiboot USB drive with ease and convenience.

You just need to copy and paste them to the USB drive and Ventoy will take care of the rest. Ventoy is compatible with most computers and supports hundreds of ISO files from various sources. It is a free and open source software that you can download and use without any limitations.
